# BooksHandler
Manipulate a book repository using multiple classes
REMARK - you should run the program in the main file. The library is empty, you just have to add some books and then make operations.


Objectives

Using Python to solve complex problems
 Implement simple programs using Python 
 Implement classes
 Treat exceptions

Requirements
Implement an application to manage a list of books. 
Consider the following layers:
 Domain layer( with class Book)
 Infrastructure layer (with class BookRepository)
 Application layer (with class BookController)
 User interface layer (with class BookUI)
Class Book – information about code, list of authors, title, year, price.
